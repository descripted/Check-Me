# Check-Me
## Hello, Koria Here this is a thing to check on how I am doing while I will be away for a very very long time maybe till christmas/next year 
### Entry #1 I've doing pretty horrible right now but I'm pretty sure it will be better overtime :D

### Entry #2 I've been doing better I wish I had my PC and Phone though I always lose my stuff for odd reasons or sometimes over my personality in the real word which is fucking annoying but hey I'm doing fine and appearntly I'm not on punishment they just taking it till they see changes.

### Entry #3 I about to get kicked out of the house for saying my mom is "a dog on a leash" out of anger  cause my stepdad took away my fan for it being on too long I know they did give me aaaa-lot of warning before they handle it so yesterday on Oct 31. 22 even though I always turned it off when I left my room but appearently this time I didn't turn it off. In my Biological Father DMs.In "2 weeks" I will be at my dads house but I call it bluff hopefully. and the crazy part is there taking my phone and service so when it times up so I won't be able to contact anyone for a while unless my dad buys me a actual phone. I don't wanna go to my dads house I want to go to my grandma's house but it's not a option cause my mom said "You only want to go there so you don't have to do whatever". Which isn't true I just wanna see my cousins and take a break so if I'm still in this house hopefully. I should be able to go with my grandma over the summer.

### Entry #4 I got caught lying/tampering/

snooping/stealing in my parents room and I got a la belt didn't hurt that bad only for like 1 second. I miss you all already most importantly my love <3 but I just wanna know if you are reading this remember I love you please wait for me on summer.
