# Check-Me
## Hello, Koria Here this is a thing to check on how I am doing while I will be away for a very very long time maybe till christmas/next year 
### Entry #1 I've doing pretty horrible right now but I'm pretty sure it will be better overtime :D

### Entry #2 I've been doing better I wish I had my PC and Phone though I always lose my stuff for odd reasons or sometimes over my personality in the real word which is fucking annoying but hey I'm doing fine and appearntly I'm not on punishment they just taking it till they see changes.
